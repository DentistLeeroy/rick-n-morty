# RicknMorty

For this assignment you've been placed in randomized groups. And will be building an application, using the component library you just contributed to.

All of your inidividual components have been merged to the master branch on my repository, so you and your group can create a new fork or clone it, so you have the component library to work with.

You're to build an application capable of browsing the Characters, Locations and Episodes of the "Rick and Morty" tv show.

# Design

The design is available in this figma file (https://www.figma.com/file/gQdbPawm0ZhGfodZYqkd01/Rick-n-Morty---GraphQL?node-id=0%3A1&t=sgMrPTdELRShad9V-0)

# Pagination

Google on: Pagination

For the Characters page, use the "load more" technique.
And for the Episodes page use the "pagination" technique.
Assess and use what you see for fit for the Locations page.

# Integration/Backend

You'll be getting data from this API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#graphql), using GraphQL ([GraphiQL explorer](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql)).
You will not be using REST endpoints in this assignment, and you're not allowed to use their client.

# Requirements

Build the frontend using React, TypeScript, our component library, and for this assignment you can use React Router and Apollo.

The minimum product is an app that can show the 3 master-pages: characters, locations and episodes, including their detail-page, in the provided design.

From there you can add features like searching or filtering.

# Deliverable:

A link to your groups repository.
